# ML-Model-for-Crop-yield-Prediction (Crop Yield Prediction System)

# Overview

The Crop Yield Prediction System leverages machine learning techniques to forecast crop yields based on historical data. This system utilizes an ensemble approach combining a Decision Tree Regressor with an AdaBoost Regressor to enhance prediction accuracy. By integrating these methods, we aim to provide reliable predictions that help determine the most suitable crop to cultivate based on various parameters such as location and weather conditions.

# Key Features
**Ensemble Model:** Combines Decision Tree Regressor with AdaBoost Regressor to improve prediction accuracy.

**Enhanced Accuracy:** The ensemble method addresses the limitations of a single Decision Tree, resulting in more reliable yield forecasts.

**Crop Selection:** Assists in determining the optimal crop to grow by analyzing historical data and current parameters.

**Top 10 Crops:** Focuses on the top 10 crops that address the majority of agricultural challenges based on location and weather conditions.

# Methodology
**Decision Tree Regressor:** Provides an initial predictive model but may struggle with weak results.

**AdaBoost Regressor:** Enhances the Decision Tree model by boosting its performance, improving accuracy significantly.

**Prediction System:** Uses the combined model to predict crop yields, helping users make informed decisions about crop cultivation.

# Application
This system supports farmers and agricultural planners in making data-driven decisions about which crops to plant, aiming to optimize yield based on historical data and current environmental conditions.

# Timeline
Developed: Nov 2020 - April 2021

# Collaboration

**Team Members:** Collaborated with 3 team members who played key roles in the project.

**Data Gathering: **Assisted in collecting and preparing the historical crop yield data.

**Testing:** Contributed to testing the model and ensuring its accuracy and reliability.

**Documenting:** Helped in documenting the methodology, results, and usage instructions.
